# Medal.TV Toolbox

This project started out as a very simple PowerShell Script that served the same purpose this project does but everything was hard coded into the script but I needed to all of my clips to different directories for easy of access for my [YouTube videos](https://youtube.com/@EndLordHD). So I decided to re-write in Python and now in Go because Python was slow and the project was very clutered. Here's the old repo for the Python version of this project: https://github.com/EndCod3r/medal-tools
